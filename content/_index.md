I'm a Malay language teacher with the [Ministry of Education, Singapore](https://www.moe.gov.sg). A Malay quatrain (pantun) enthusiast, I first participated in [NUS Pesta Pantun](https://www.instagram.com/pestapantunsg/) in 2006 and is now involved regularly as jury for NUS Pesta Pantun, Singapore Polytechnic's [SPantun](https://www.instagram.com/spantunsg/), and have also once judged a regional pantun competition by [Temasya Pantun Piala Seri Melaka - PISMA (Malaysia)](https://www.instagram.com/temasya_pantun_pisma/). I also build my own teaching resources such as card games and board games for Malay language learning.
